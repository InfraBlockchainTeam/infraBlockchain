# What is InfraBlockchain Block Producer node

In the InfraBlockchain network, block production and block validation are performed by special nodes called "InfraBlockchain Producer node". Producer nodes are elected by InfraBlockchain stakeholders via PoT Consensus Algorithm. Each validator node runs an instance of a InfraBlockchain node using the `infra-node` service. For this reason, validators that are on the active schedule to produce blocks are also called "active" or "producing" validator nodes.

Before getting started as a block producer, you need to know a few things:

1. A block producer needs to know it's role & fulfil the requirements.
2. Having more block producers are healthier and better for the InfraBlockchain ecosystem, especially block producers that are committed to transparency and being in a state of giving continuous contribution.
3. Block producers are a core component of InfraBlockchain network built on EOSIO protocol.
4. Below is the guide to get a node up and running as a block producer on InfraBlockchain.

## What is the role of a InfraBlockchain block producer

* Block producer nodes are decentralized entities that govern the InfraBlockchain blockchain. block producer will produce the blocks of the InfraBlockchain.
* InfraBlockchain block producers play a key role in the operation of the network.
  * They provide stability, reliability, security and extensive infrastructure coverage for InfraBlockchain network.
  * Contribute to InfraBlockchain development toolkits, so as to get noticed by the voters & stay in BP list eligible for incentives.
* InfraBlockchain block producers verify transactions on the InfraBlockchain network by collecting transaction data and storing that information in blocks.&#x20;
  * Once a block is prepared, validators broadcast the block to the network for verification.
* Block producers are responsible for InfraBlockchain infrastructure growth, community support and education, and financial support for development of InfraBlockchain DApps.
* Block producer need to participate in on-chain governance.&#x20;

The next section will discuss the different types of nodes on the InfraBlockchain network.
