# What is InfraBlockchain?

## What is InfraBlockchain

InfraBlockchain introduces a new method of enterprise-oriented public/permissioned blockchain system design without issuing a native cryptocurrency minted by the blockchain itself.

InfraBlockchain provides innovative blockchain system architecture overcoming the obstacles of private and public blockchains which prevent enterprises and public institutions from utilizing the full potential of blockchain technology.



## Key Features of InfraBlockchain

**No Native Cryptocurrency**

New method of public blockchain design that avoids issuing native cryptocurrency minted by the blockchain itself. There is no single distinguished built-in native token, only user-created tokens are issued and circulated on the InfraBlockchain. In other smart contract based blockchains like Ethereum and EOS, custom tokens implemented as smart contracts are totally separate from the native cryptocurrency (ETH, EOS) used for executing blockchain transactions. In contrast, InfraBlockchain lets any custom user token conforming to the InfraBlockchain Standard Token interface become a Transaction Fee Token just as a native cryptocurrency can in other blockchain systems.

**InfraBlockchain Standard Token Model**

The InfraBlockchain provides a unique InfraBlockchain Standard Token model. Every account created can mint a InfraBlockchain Standard Token and inherently run standard token operations natively supported at the blockchain core level. Interoperability among the tokens on the InfraBlockchain is enforced and guaranteed by the blockchain core system.

**Fiat-Pegged Stable Tokens, Asset-Backed Security Tokens**

User-created fiat-pegged stable tokens (e.g. USD tokens backed by an equivalent amount of USD held in reserve) issued by trusted entities (e.g. enterprises, financial institutions, governments) are selected as the transaction fee tokens. Asset-backed security tokens (e.g. company shares, gold backed tokens, ...) can be also issued and traded through on-chain token exchange using fiat-pegged stable tokens as base currencies.

**Transaction Fee Tokens Selected from User-Created Tokens**

Among the user-issued tokens, the elected block producers can select some tokens to be used for blockchain transaction fee payment, whereas typically a pre-built native cryptocurrency is used in other blockchain systems. Whenever any blockchain transaction is executed on the InfraBlockchain, the block-producer-designated transaction fee tokens are collected as a transaction fee from users.

**Proof-of-Transaction (PoT) Consensus Mechanism**

The block producers of the InfraBlockchain are elected by a unique consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Transaction (PoT) using Transaction-as-a-Vote (TaaV). The block producers are continuously elected and evicted by the transparent and fair vote index, the proof of generating meaningful transactions. The PoT mechanism incentivizes the application service providers, who are directly contributing to the blockchain ecosystem by generating blockchain transactions associated with real economic activity.

**Delegable Transaction Fee Payment**

The transaction fee payer is always specified separately from the accounts directly involved in a transaction, the transaction fee payment can be delegated to some other account. For the sake of a seamless and convenient user experience, blockchain service providers can pay blockchain transaction fees on behalf of the service’s users.

**Smart Contract Enabled General Financial Platform**

The InfraBlockchain is designed to be a general financial platform supporting smart contracts. Business entities can process their financial transactions on the InfraBlockchain using the fiat-pegged stable tokens and custom smart contract codes developed to meet the needs of their business process.

**Integrated KYC/AML Support and Account Recovery**

The integrated KYC/AML process for InfraBlockchain accounts is provided by trusted Identity Authorities designated by block producers, which lays the foundation for the secure and reliable financial transactions maintaining regulatory compliance. The blockchain account recovery is provided by the Identity Authorities mitigating the blockchain key loss problem.

**Scalable Blockchain Architecture**

The enterprise level blockchain scalability enabled by the PoT-based BFT consensus with short block time and fast block finality, the InfraBlockchain’s off-chain state-channel exchange technology and the future multi-blockchain architecture. The InfraBlockchain enables financial transaction processing at global scale.
