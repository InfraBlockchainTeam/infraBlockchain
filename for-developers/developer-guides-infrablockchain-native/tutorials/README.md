We believe that the best way to learn how to build a DApp on the InfraBlockchain blockchain is to be guided step-by-step to build something tangible that can be observed by other users. For that reason we are going to start off with a minimal interaction with the InfraBlockchain blockchain, followed by building a simple to-do list application.

### Create a testnet account, repeat this process as much as you need for development purposes

1. Generate keys either using `infra-cli` command line wallet or another tool
2. Use the Testnet Faucet to create an account and get some testnet system token
3. Import those keys into your wallet of choice, and write them down somewhere you will not lose them!
